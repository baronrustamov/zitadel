## More

While we are not actively maintaining the following projects, it is worth checking out if you're interested in exploring ZITADEL in different programming languages or frameworks.

- [NodeJS passport](https://github.com/buehler/node-passport-zitadel) authentication helper
- [Dart library for ZITADEL](https://github.com/smartive/zitadel-dart), contains gRPC and API access elements
- [NextAuth Provider for ZITADEL](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/zitadel)

If we do not provide an example, SDK or guide, we strongly recommend using existing authentication libraries for your language or framework instead of building your own.
Certified libraries have undergone rigorous testing and validation to ensure high security and reliability.
There are many recommended libraries available, this saves time and ensures that users' data is well-protected.
